\section{Compliant Contact, Principle of Maximum Dissipation and Artifacts}
\label{sec:physical_intuition}

Thus far, $\vf{R}_i$ and $\hat{\vf{v}}_{c,i}$ have been treated as known problem
data. This section makes an explicit connection of these quantities with
physical parameters to model compliant contact with regularized friction. Notice
this approach is different from the one in \cite{bib:todorov2014}, where
regularization is not used to model physical compliance but rather to introduce
a user tunable Baumgarte-style stabilization to avoid constraint drift. We want
to model compliant contact with stiffness $k$ (in N/m) and linear
dissipation $c = \tau_d k$ where $\tau_d$ (in seconds) is the \textit{dissipation
time scale}. 

Dropping subscript $i$ for simplicity, we solve the projection problem in Eq.
(\ref{eq:y_projection}) analytically in Appendix
\ref{app:analytical_inverse_dynamics_derivations} for a regularization matrix of
the form
\begin{align}	
	\vf{R} = \text{diag}([R_t, R_t, R_n]) = 
	\begin{bmatrix}
		R_t &   0 & 0\\
		  0 & R_t & 0\\
		  0 &   0 & R_n
	\end{bmatrix}.
    \label{eq:Rk}
\end{align} 

The solution to  Eq. (\ref{eq:y_projection}) can be written as
\begin{eqnarray}
	\bgamma &=& P_\mathcal{F}(\vf{y})
    \label{eq:analytical_y_projection}\\
    &=&\begin{dcases}
	% Region I, stiction
	\vf{y} 
	% When we  have:
	& \text{stiction, } y_r \le \mu y_n\\
	%
	%
	% Region II, sliding.
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\mu\gamma_n\hat{\vf{t}}\\
		\frac{1}{1+\tilde\mu^2}\left(y_n +
        \hat\mu y_r\right)
	\end{bmatrix}
	% When we  have:
	& \text{sliding, } -\hat\mu y_r < y_n \leq \frac{y_r}{\mu}\\
	%
	%
	% Region III, no contact.
    \vf{0} & \text{no contact, } y_n < -\hat\mu y_r
\end{dcases}\nonumber	
\end{eqnarray}
where $\vf{y}_t$ and $y_n$ are the tangential and normal components of $\vf{y}$,
$y_r=\Vert\vf{y}_t\Vert$ is the radial component, and $\hat{\vf{t}}=\vf{y}_t/y_r$
is the unit tangent vector. We also define the coefficients
$\tilde\mu=\mu\,(R_t/R_n)^{1/2}$ and $\hat\mu=\mu\,R_t/R_n$ that
result from the \textit{warping} introduced by the metric $\vf{R}$.

Our compliant model of contact is defined by
\begin{eqnarray}
	\hat{\vf{v}}_c &=&
	\begin{bmatrix}
		0\\
		0\\
		\hat{v}_n \end{bmatrix}\nonumber\\
	\hat{v}_n &=& -\frac{\phi_0}{\delta t+\tau_d}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\phi_0$ is the previous step signed distance. The normal direction
regularization parameters in Eq. (\ref{eq:Rk}) is taken as $R_n^{-1} = \delta t
k(\delta t+\tau_d)$. To gain physical insight into our model, we substitute
$\vf{y}=-\vf{R}^{-1}(\vf{v}_c - \hat{\vf{v}}_c)$ into Eq.
(\ref{eq:analytical_y_projection}) to obtain
\begin{align}
	&\bgamma(\vf{v}_c) = P_\mathcal{F}(\vf{y}(\vf{v}_c))
    \label{eq:gamma_analytical_from_vc}\\
&=\begin{dcases}
	% Region I, stiction
	\begin{bmatrix}
		-\vf{v}_t/R_t\\
		-\delta t(k\phi + c v_n)
	\end{bmatrix}
	% When we  have: y_r < \mu y_n
	& \text{stiction, } \\
	%
	%
	% Region II, sliding.
	\begin{bmatrix}
		\mu\gamma_n\hat{\vf{t}}\\
		-\frac{\delta t}{1+\tilde\mu^2}\left(k(\phi-(\delta
		t+\tau_d)\mu\Vert\vf{v}_t\Vert) + cv_n \right)
	\end{bmatrix}
	% When we  have:  -\mu \frac{R_t}{R_n} y_r < y_n \leq \frac{y_r}{\mu}
	& \text{sliding, }\\
	%
	%
	% Region III, no contact.  y_n \leq -\mu \frac{R_t}{R_n} y_r
    \vf{0} & \text{no contact, } \end{dcases}\nonumber	
\end{align}
where $\phi= \phi_0 + \delta t\,v_n$. Let us now analyze the resulting forces
from this model.

\subsection{Friction Forces}
From Eq. (\ref{eq:gamma_analytical_from_vc}) we see that friction forces behave
exactly as a model of regularized friction
\begin{equation}
	\bgamma_t = \min\left(\frac{\Vert\vf{v}_t\Vert}{R_t}, \mu\gamma_n\right)\hat{\vf{t}}
\end{equation}
with $\bgamma_t$ linear to the (very small) slip velocity during stiction and
with a maximum value given by $\mu\gamma_n$, effectively modeling Coulomb
friction. Notice that to better model stiction, we are interested in small
values of $R_t$. We discuss our parameterization of $R_t$ in
Section \ref{sec:understanding_model_parameters}.

Since $\hat{\vf{t}} = \vf{y}_t/\Vert\vf{y}_t\Vert =
-\vf{v}_t/\Vert\vf{v}_t\Vert$, friction forces oppose sliding and therefore
satisfy the principle of maximum dissipation as desired.

\subsection{Normal Forces}
We observe that in stiction, normal forces model compliance with linear
stiffness $k$ and linear dissipation $c = \tau_d k$. That is
\begin{equation}
    \gamma_n/ \delta t = -k\phi - c v_n.
\end{equation}

In the sliding region, however, we see that the convex approximation introduces
unphysical artifacts. 

Firstly, the factor $1+\tilde{\mu}^2$ models an effective stiffness
$k_\text{eff}=k/(1+\tilde{\mu}^2)$ and dissipation
$c_\text{eff}=c/(1+\tilde{\mu}^2)$, different from the physical values. This
tell us that in order to accurately model compliance during sliding we must
satisfy the condition $\tilde\mu=\mu\,(R_t/R_n)^{1/2} \approx 0$ or,
equivalently, $R_t \ll R_n$. Section \ref{sec:understanding_model_parameters}
introduces a parameterization of $R_t$ that satisfies this condition.

Secondly, while we'd like to recover $\gamma_n = -\delta t(k\phi + c v_n)$ as in
stiction, we instead see that the slip velocity $\vf{v}_t$
unphysically couples into the normal forces as $\gamma_n=-\delta
t(k(\phi-(\delta t+\tau_d)\mu\Vert\vf{v}_t\Vert) + cv_n)$. We can write this as
\begin{equation}
  \gamma_n/\delta t=-(k\phi_\text{eff} + c v_n)
\end{equation}
with an \textit{effective} signed distance $\phi_\text{eff} = \phi-(\delta
t+\tau_d)\mu\Vert\vf{v}_t\Vert$. That is, we recover the dynamics of compliant
contact but with a spurious drift of magnitude 
$(\delta t+\tau_d)\mu\Vert\vf{v}_t\Vert$.

This is consistent with the formulation in \cite{bib:anitescu2010} for rigid
contact when $k\rightarrow \infty$ and $\tau_d=0$, leading to an unphysical
\textit{gliding effect} at a positive distance $\phi=\delta
t\mu\Vert\vf{v}_t\Vert$. Notice that the \textit{gliding} goes away as $\delta
t\rightarrow 0$ since the formulation converges to the original contact problem
\cite{bib:anitescu2006}. The effect of compliance is to \textit{soften} this
gliding effect. 

With finite compliance,  the normal force when sliding goes to
$-k(\phi-\tau_d\mu\Vert\vf{v}_t\Vert)$ in the limit to $\delta t\rightarrow 0$. This tells us that, unlike the rigid case, the \textit{gliding}
effect unfortunately does not go away as $\delta t\rightarrow 0$. It persists
with a finite value that now depends on the dissipation rate,
$\phi\approx\tau_d\mu\Vert\vf{v}_t\Vert$.

We close this discussion by making the following remarks relevant to robotics
applications:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item We are mostly interested in the stiction
	regime, typically for grasping, locomotion, or rolling contact for mobile
	bases with wheels. This regime is precisely where the convex approximation
	does not introduce artifacts.
	\item Sliding usually happens with low velocities and therefore the term
	$\delta t\mu\Vert\vf{v}_t\Vert$ is negligible.
	\item For robotics applications, we are mostly interested in inelastic
	contact. We will see that this can be effectively modeled with
	$\tau_d\approx\delta t$ in Section \ref{sec:understanding_model_parameters}.
	Therefore, in this regime, the term $\tau_d\mu\Vert\vf{v}_t\Vert$ also goes
	to zero as $\delta t\rightarrow 0$.
	\item We are definitely interested in the onset of sliding.
	This is captured by the approximation which properly models the Colulomb
	friction law.
\end{enumerate}
