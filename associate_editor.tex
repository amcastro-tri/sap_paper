\textcolor{blue}{Three Reviewers evaluated the submitted paper. Their comments
are reported and should be carefully followed. In particular, the Reviewers
highlighted several criticisms.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Linearization effects should be better highlighted (Reviewer 1).
    \item It seems that the approach has an implicitly defined constraint,
\end{itemize}
which contradicts the claim of an unconstrained problem. If this impression is
confirmed, then the global convergence of the method becomes unclear (Reviewer
1).}
