\section{Contact Modeling Parameters}
\label{sec:contact_modeling_parameters}

Thus far, $\vf{R}_i$ and $\hat{\vf{v}}_{c,i}$ have been treated as known problem
data. This section makes an explicit connection of these quantities with
physical parameters to model compliant contact with regularized friction. We
seek to model compliant contact as in Eq. (\ref{eq:compliant_model}),
parameterized by physical parameters; stiffness $k$ (in N/m) and
\textit{dissipation time scale} $\tau_d$ (in seconds). Therefore, users of this
model only need to provide these physical parameters and regularization is
computed from them. Notice this approach is different from the one in
\cite{bib:todorov2014}, where regularization is not used to model physical
compliance but rather to introduce a user tunable Baumgarte-style stabilization
to avoid constraint drift.
