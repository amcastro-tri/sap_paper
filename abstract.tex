We present a convex formulation of compliant frictional contact and a robust, 
performant method to solve it in practice. By analytically eliminating contact
constraints, we obtain an unconstrained convex problem over just velocities
for which we prove our solver has global convergence. Specified by physical parameters, our model can be described in clear
physical terms, rather than in abstract optimization-specific terminology. This permits not only the modeling of compliant point-contact, but also more sophisticated models of compliant surface patches 
that are often needed for high-fidelity simulation. 
Moreover, we provide explicit analytical
expressions for contact forces as a function of state, which allows us to
characterize artifacts introduced by the convex approximation in a novel and
transparent way.
Our time stepping scheme
is based on the $\theta\text{-method}$, a common generalization
of the popular symplectic Euler method and the second order
midpoint rule. We demonstrate that the midpoint rule can achieve second order
accuracy even with frictional contact. We introduce a number of accuracy metrics
and show that our method outperforms existing commercial and open source
alternatives without sacrificing accuracy.
Effective warm-starting
enables simulation at interactive rates of complex robotic manipulation systems
with frictional contact among rigid and compliant objects. 
Finally, we demonstrate robust
simulation of robotic manipulation tasks at interactive rates, with accurately
resolved stiction and contact transitions, as required for meaningful
sim-to-real transfer. Our method is implemented in the open source robotics
toolkit Drake.
