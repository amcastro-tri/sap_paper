We present a convex formulation of compliant contact along with with a robust
iterative method to solve it in practice. Our formulation eliminates contact
constraints analytically to write an unconstrained convex formulation of
frictional contact on velocities only, with guaranteed unique solution. Written in velocities only, we show our method warms-starts effectively using velocities computed at the previous time step, enabling the simulation of complex multibody systems with frictional contact at interactive rates. 

Our time stepping approach is based on the $\theta\text{-method}$, which includes the second order midpoint rule. Our method linearizes the discrete $\theta\text{-method}$, introduces a positive definite approximation of its gradients, and solves a single quadratic program with second order cone constraints per time step.

We demonstrate with our numerical simulations that when using the midpoint rule
our approach conserves energy very well (\RedHighlight{use another term}) for
systems with rolling contact.

We show our method can solve to tight tolerances enabling the simulation of challenging robotics tasks, such peg-in-hole task with dexterous hands.
