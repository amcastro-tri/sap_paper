We present a convex formulation of compliant frictional contact and a robust,
performant method to solve it in practice. By analytically eliminating contact
constraints, we obtain an unconstrained convex problem. Our solver has proven
global convergence and warm-starts effectively, enabling simulation at
interactive rates. We develop compact analytical expressions of contact forces
allowing us to describe our model in clear physical terms and to rigorously
characterize our approximations. Moreover, this enables us not only to model
point contact, but also to incorporate sophisticated models of compliant contact
patches. Our time stepping scheme includes the midpoint rule, which we
demonstrate achieves second order accuracy even with frictional contact. We
introduce a number of accuracy metrics and show our method outperforms existing
commercial and open source alternatives without sacrificing accuracy. Finally,
we demonstrate robust simulation of robotic manipulation tasks at interactive
rates, with accurately resolved stiction and contact transitions, as required
for meaningful sim-to-real transfer. Our method is implemented in the open
source robotics toolkit Drake.
