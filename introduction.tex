\CyanHighlight{\IEEEPARstart{I}{ntro} paragraph stating why sim and modeling
with contact is important for robotics planning and control plus some
sim-to-real bullshit.}

Rigid body dynamics with frictional contact is complicated by the non-smooth
nature of the solutions. It is well known \cite{bib:baraff1993issues} that rigid
contact when combined with the Coulomb model of friction can lead to paradoxical
configurations for which solutions in terms of accelerations and forces
do not exist. These phenomena are known as Painlev\'e paradoxes
\cite{bib:hogan2017regularization}. Theory resolves these paradoxes by allowing
discrete velocity jumps and impulsive forces, formally casting the problem as a
differential variational inequality \cite{bib:pang2008differential}. In practice
event based approaches can resolve impulsive transitions \cite{bib:haug1986},
though it is not clear how to detect these events even for simple one degree of
freedom systems \cite{bib:hogan2017regularization}.

Nevertheless, the problem can be solved in a weaker formulation at the velocity
level using a time-stepping scheme where the next step velocities and impulses
(integral of the forces over a given time step) are the unknowns at each time
step \cite{bib:stewart1996implicit, bib:anitescu1997}. These formulations lead
in general to a non-linear complementarity problem (NCP) and to a linear
complementarity problem (LCP) when a polyhedral approximation of the friction
cone is used. Even though LCP formulations guarantee solution existence
\cite{bib:anitescu1997, bib:stewart1998convergence}, their accurate and
efficient solution has remained difficult in practice. This has been explained
in part to the fact that these formulations are equivalent to nonconvex problems
in global optimization, which are generally NP-hard \cite{bib:Kaufman2008}.
Indeed, the popular direct methods based on Lemke's pivoting algorithm to solve
LCPs may exhibit exponential worst-case complexity \cite{bib:baraff1994fast}. As
popular as direct pivoting methods, iterative methods based on projected
Gauss-Seidel (PGS) \cite{bib:duriez2006_realistic_haptic_rendering, bib:bullet}
have also shown exponentially slow convergence \cite{bib:erleben2007velocity}.
These observations are not just of a purely theoretical value, but in practice
methods to compute contact forces often lack robustness and are numerically
brittle. This inherent lack stability and robustness is tackled in software with
large amounts of non-physical constraint softening and stabilization. Still,
simulations require a significant amount of parameter tunning to make them
work.

\RedHighlight{Careful not to say twice what we talk about in Section
\ref{sec:previous_work}. See if worth merging or how to consolidate these two.}

To improve computational tractability, Anitescu introduces a \textit{convex
relaxation} of the contact problem \cite{bib:anitescu2006}. This relaxation is a
convex approximation with proven convergence to the solution of a measure
differential inclusion as the time step goes to zero. The convex approximation
introduces a \emph{gliding} artifact for sliding contacts at a distance $\phi$
proportional to the time step size $\delta t$ and to the sliding velocity
$\Vert\vf{v}_t\Vert$ \cite{bib:mazhar2014}, i.e. $\phi\sim \delta
t\Vert\vf{v}_t\Vert$. Therefore the approximation is exact for sticking contact
and it can be adequate for robotics applications for which the
product $\delta t\Vert\vf{v}_t\Vert$ can be sufficiently small. For trajectory
optimization, Todorov \cite{bib:todorov2011} introduces regularization into
Anitescu's formulation in order to write a strictly convex formulation with a
unique, smooth and invertible solution. For simulation, Todorov
\cite{bib:todorov2014} uses regularization to introduce \emph{numerical
compliance} as a means of a Baumgarte-like stabilization and avoid constraints
drift. As a side effect, the regularized formulation can lead to a noticeable
non-zero slip velocity even during stiction \cite{bib:simbenchmark}.

Even though these formulations introduce a tractable approximation of frictional
contact, somehow they haven't become a popular solution approach in practice. We
believe this is not because the approximation is not suitable for robotics
applications, but rather because of the lack of robust solution methods with a
computational cost suitable for real-time simulation. Sofware such as ODE
\cite{bib:ode}, Dart \cite{bib:dart} and Vortex \cite{bib:vortex} use a
polyhedral approximation of the friction cone leading to an LCP formulation.
Algoryx \cite{bib:algoryx} uses a \emph{split solver}, reminiscent of one
iteration in the staggered projections method \cite{bib:Kaufman2008}. Drake
\cite{bib:drake} solves compliant contact with regularized friction with its
transition aware solver TAMSI \cite{bib:castro2020}. 

To the knowledge of the authors, Chrono \cite{bib:hrono2016} and Mujoco
\cite{bib:mujoco} are the only software that implement the convex approximation
of contact. The multi-physics simulation package Chrono
implements a variant of the PGS method for solving Anitescu's convex formulation
\cite{bib:tasora2011}. This method is specially targeted to the simulation of
very large scale systems as those found in granular flow. Even though some
convergence guarantees are provided in \cite{bib:anitescu2010}, the solver
exhibits low convergences rates. This is expected for such first order method.
Mujoco is a software targeted to robotics that implements both a PGS solver
variant \cite{bib:todorov2014} and a second order Newton solver. However the
underlying technology is proprietary and implementation details are not known in
the community.

Summarizing, after more than 15 years after the introduction of these convex
approximations, robust and performant algorithms for their solution in practice
are lacking. It is not even clear in the community if these formulations present
a real advantage when compared to more traditional approaches and whether the
artifacts introduced by the approximation are appropriate for robotics
applications. In this work we aim to provide answers to these questions. 

To answer the question of physical accuracy and validity of the approximation,
in Section \ref{sec:physical_intuition} we build on Todorov's work
\cite{bib:todorov2014} to write compact analytical expressions of the impulses
that provide a clear physical interpretation of the convex formulation. This
allow us to succinctly describe the model in physical terms rather than in
optimization specific terms that might be elusive to non-experts on optimization. Moreover, the artifacts introduced by the approximation become apparent and can be characterized precisely.



We summarize our contributions as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \sout{We build on Todorov's work \cite{bib:todorov2014} to write compact
	analytical expressions of the impulses that provide a clear physical
	interpretation of the convex formulation.}
	\item We show how to use these expressions to incorporate the modeling of
	physical compliance and even complex models of \RedHighlight{compliant
	surface patches. [Reference to arxiv version]}. This is different from
	\cite{bib:todorov2014} where regularization is used as a Baumgarte-like
	stabilization.
	\item \sout{Our clear analogy with compliant contact allow us to succinctly
	describe the artifacts introduced by the convex approximation of contact.}
	\item We present a discrete time stepping approach based on the
	$\theta\text{-method}$. This includes the popular symplectic Euler and the
	implicit midpoint rule. We demonstrate the midpoint rule can achieve second
	order accuracy even in problems with frictional contact.
	\item We write a primal formulation of compliant contact written in terms of
	velocities, in contrast to the dual formulations in terms of impulses
	introduced by Anitescu and Todorov.
	\item We develop our Semi-Analytical Primal solver (SAP) which eliminates
the contact constraints analytically to write an unconstrained convex
formulation. We provide thorough details for its practical implementation.
	\item We find that, unlike formulations on impulses, SAP warms starts effectively using velocities from the previous time step. 
	\item We evaluate the accuracy, robustness and performance of SAP against available commercial and open-source solvers.
	\item We show how a judicious parameterization of regularization allows for a tight resolution of stiction without sacrificing performance. This is critical for the simulation of demanding robotics tasks such as manipulation.
	\item Our method is implemented in the open-source robotics toolkit Drake \cite{bib:drake}.
