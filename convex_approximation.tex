\section{Convex Approximation of Contact Dynamics}
\label{sec:convex_approximation}

Previous work from Anitescu \cite{bib:anitescu2006} introduces an approximation
of the nonpenetration constraint Eq. \eqref{eq:scheme_nonpenetration} that
together with Eqs. \eqref{eq:scheme_mdp_multiplier}-\eqref{eq:scheme_mdp_cone}
leads to a convex formulation in impulses. Though not strictly applicable to
contact problems, later on Todorov \cite{bib:todorov2011, bib:todorov2014} uses
the \emph{Gauss's principle of least constraint} to obtain a regularized form of
Anitescu's formulation that admits a unique solution. Moreover, Todorov shows
that impulses can be constructed from the computed velocities, an operation
referred to as \textit{analytical inverse dynamics}.

In this section we build from this previous work to write a convex formulation
of compliant contact. Our convex optimization problem is formulated in terms of
velocities and we show that (with symplectic Euler) its dual corresponds to
Todorov's \cite{bib:todorov2014} formulation in impulses. Further, we use
Todorov's \textit{analytical inverse dynamics} to eliminate constraints
analytically and write an unconstrained formulation.
