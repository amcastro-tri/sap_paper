\section{Convex Approximation of Contact Dynamics}\label{sec:convex_approximation}

Previous work from Anitescu~\cite{bib:anitescu2006} introduces an approximation
of the nonpenetration constraint that together with
Eqs.~\eqref{eq:scheme_mdp_multiplier}-\eqref{eq:scheme_mdp_cone} leads to a
convex formulation in impulses. Later on Todorov~\cite{bib:todorov2011,
bib:todorov2014} uses the \emph{Gauss's principle of least constraint} to obtain
a regularized form of Anitescu's formulation that admits a unique solution.
Moreover, Todorov shows that impulses can be constructed from the computed
velocities, an operation referred to as \textit{analytical inverse dynamics}. It
should be pointed out that the Gauss's principle of least constraint can only be
applied to problems with Tresca type dry friction, for which normal forces are
known in advance \cite{bib:yunt2014}. Therefore the Gauss's principle of least
constraint is only an approximation to the model of Coulomb friction for which
normal forces are unknown and the formulation is non-convex.

In this section we build from this previous work to write a new convex formulation
of compliant contact in terms of \emph{velocities}.  We then show that (with
symplectic Euler) its dual corresponds to Todorov's~\cite{bib:todorov2014}
formulation in impulses. Finally, we use
Todorov's \textit{analytical inverse dynamics} to eliminate constraints
analytically, yielding an unconstrained formulation.
