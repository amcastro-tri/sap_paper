\section{Convex Approximation of Contact Dynamics}
\label{sec:convex_approximation}

In this section we build from previous work on convex approximations of contact
\cite{bib:anitescu2006, bib:todorov2011, bib:todorov2014} to write a new convex
formulation of \emph{compliant} contact in terms of \emph{velocities}.  We then
show that (with symplectic Euler) its dual corresponds to
Todorov's~\cite{bib:todorov2014} formulation in impulses. Finally, we use
Todorov's \textit{analytical inverse dynamics} to eliminate constraints
analytically, yielding an unconstrained formulation.
