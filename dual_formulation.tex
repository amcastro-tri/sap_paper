\section{Convex Approximation of Contact Dynamics}
\label{sec:previous_work}

Previous work from Anitescu \cite{bib:anitescu2006} introduces a \textit{convex
approximation} of the contact problem, formulated in impulses as the
minimization of a quadratic cost with cone constraints. Though not strictly
applicable to contact problems, later on Todorov \cite{bib:todorov2011,
bib:todorov2014} uses the \emph{Gauss's principle of least constraint} to obtain
a regularized form of Anitescu's formulation that admits a unique solution.
Moreover, Todorov shows that impulses can be constructed from the computed
velocities, an operation referred to as \textit{analytical inverse dynamics}.

In this section we build from this previous work to write a convex formulation
of compliant contact. Our convex optimization problem is formulated in terms of
velocities and we show that (with symplectic Euler) its dual corresponds to
Todorov's \cite{bib:todorov2014} formulation in impulses. Further, we use
Todorov's \textit{analytical inverse dynamics} to eliminate constraints
analytically and write an unconstrained formulation.
