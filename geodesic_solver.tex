\section{Geodesic Solver}
\label{sec:geodesic_solver}

\RedHighlight{Frank: place Geodesic solver section here.}

I believe what we need to do here is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Reuse notation already in the paper. E.g. The primal formulation that
    the Geodesic solver solver is stated in Eq. (\ref{eq:primal_regularized}). 
    \item Latex stuff. When I (Alejandro) tried, some of the packages in
    `header.tex' didn't play well with the IEEEtran template.
    \item If needed, reformat to single column. 
    \item A few citations that you might find useful, \cite[\S
    9]{bib:davis2016survey}, \cite{bib:smail2017junction},
    \cite{bib:permenter2020}.
    \item Section \ref{sec:problem_sparsity} describes the sparsity of the
    problem. You might want to reference it or even update for what you might
    want to say here.
\end{itemize}
