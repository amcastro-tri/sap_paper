Dear Dr. Kevin Lynch,

We wish to submit our original research article entitled "An Unconstrained
Convex Formulation of Compliant Contact" for consideration for publication in
Transaction on Robotics. 

In this work we present a novel formulation of frictional contact along with a
robust and performant method to solve it in practice. We provide strong
mathematical guarantees, a rigorous characterization of approximations and
thorough details for implementation. Our software is made available in the open
source robotics toolkit Drake.


Our novel treatment of contact constraints enables contact rich modeling and it
is well suited for several applications in robotics including simulation,
trajectory optimization, machine learning, parameter estimation and control.
Therefore we believe that this manuscript is appropriate for publication by
Transaction on Robotics.

We have no conflicts of interest to disclose. 

Thank you for your consideration of this manuscript. Sincerely,

Alejandro Castro, PhD
Senior Research Scientist,
