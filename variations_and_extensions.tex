\section{Variations and Extensions}
\label{sec:variations_and_extensions}

\RedHighlight{Plausible topics:}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Different constraints to model bilateral constraints, PD controllers, etc.
    \item Branch induced sparsity within the same tree.
    \item Optimized algebra for 6dof free bodies.
    \item Parallelization. Discuss the concept of islands.
    \item we can delay the mention to FEM stiffness and damping to here.
    \item Differentiation (maybe?)    
\end{enumerate}
