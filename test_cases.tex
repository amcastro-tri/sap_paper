\section{Test Cases}
\label{sec:test_cases}

We evaluate the robustness, accuracy, and performance of our method in a number
of simulation tests. All simulations are carried out in a system with 24 2.2 GHz
Intel Xeon cores (E5-2650 v4) and 128 GB of RAM, running Linux. However, all of
our tests are run in a single thread.

For all of our simulations, unless otherwise specified, our model uses
$\beta=1.0$ and $\sigma=10^{-3}$ for the regularization parameters in Eq.
(\ref{eq:normal_regularization}) and Eq. (\ref{eq:tangential_regularization}),
respectively.

\subsection{Performance Comparisons Against Other Solvers}
\label{sec:about_solvers}

We evaluate commercial software Gurobi, considered an industry standard, to
solve our primal formulation \eqref{eq:primal_regularized}. As an open source option, we evaluate the Geodesic interior-point method (IPM)
from \cite{bib:permenter2020}. Geodesic IPMs, in contrast with primal-dual
IPMs, do not apply Newton's method to the central-path conditions directly.
Instead, they use geodesic curves that satisfy the complementarity slackness
condition. Since the Geodesic IPM and SAP use the same supernodal linear algebra
code described in Section \ref{sec:problem_sparsity}, it is natural to compare
their performance.

For performance comparisons, we use the steady clock from the STL
\verb+std::chrono+ library to measure wall-clock time for SAP and Geodesic IPM.
For Gurobi we access the \verb+Runtime+ property reported by Gurobi. Notice this
is somewhat unfair to SAP and Geodesic IPM since Gurobi's reported time does not
include the cost of the initial setup.
